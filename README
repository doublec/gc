C++ Garbage Collection Library
==============================

This is a library to manage memory in C++ programs using a garbage
collector. It uses a mark and sweep algorithm.

All objects that are to be managed by the collector should be derived
from GCObject:

  class Test : public GCObject {
    ...
  };

If the object maintains references to other GC managed objects it
should override 'markChildren' to call 'mark' on those objects:

  class Test2 : public GCObject {
    private:
      Test* mTest;

    public:
      virtual void markChildren() {
        mTest->mark();
      }
    ...
  };

Periodic calls to GarbageCollector::GC.collect() should be made to
delete unreferenced objects and free memory. This call will call
'mark' on all the root objects, ensuring that they and their children
are not deleted, and and remaining objects are destroyed.

To add an object as a root, call GarbageCollector::GC.addRoot().
